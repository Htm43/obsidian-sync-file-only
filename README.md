# Obsidian Sync File Only Plugin

This plugin pairs panes 1:1 so opening a file in one automatically opens it in its paired pane. You can have multiple independent pairs.

## Features

- **Pair-based sync**: One-to-one pairing; you can keep multiple independent pairs
- **Auto-create partner**: If no partner exists, a new split with the same file is created and paired
- **Auto-restore links**: Optionally restore linked panes on restart (disabled by default)
- **Unlink panes**: Easily break links via command palette or right-click menu
- **Non-intrusive**: Unlinked panes (Calendar, File Explorer, etc.) are not affected
- **Two ways to link**: Command palette or tab right-click

## How to Use

### Linking Panes

1. **Install & enable**: Place the plugin in your vault and enable it in Settings → Community plugins
2. **Link a pair** (either way):
    - Command palette: Ctrl/Cmd+P → "Link this pane for file sync"
    - Tab right-click: Right-click a file tab → "Link this pane for file sync"
3. **What happens**:
    - Searches the main editor area for another tab with the same file open
    - If found, pairs with that tab
    - If not found, auto-creates a vertical split with the same file and pairs with it
    - Only that paired pane will sync with this one; other pairs stay independent
    - Sidebar panes (Calendar, File Explorer) are ignored
    - A 🔗 indicator appears on linked pane tabs

### Unlinking Panes

- Command palette: "Unlink this pane from sync"
- Tab right-click: Right-click a linked tab → "Unlink this pane from sync"
- Closing a linked pane automatically unlinks its partner

### Auto-Restore Links (Optional)

Enable "Auto-restore links on restart" in Settings → Sync File Only to automatically restore your pane links when Obsidian restarts.

- Links are saved instantly when created, modified, or removed
- On restart, links are restored if the same files are open
- Disabled by default

## Example

- Pair A-B: link Pane A with Pane B → they sync with each other
- Pair C-D: link Pane C with Pane D → they sync with each other, independent of A-B
- If only Pane A exists: running "Link this pane for file sync" auto-creates a partner split, opens the same file, and pairs A with the new pane

## What this plugin does NOT sync

- **Cursor position**: Each pane maintains its own cursor, scroll, and edit state independently
- **Selections**: Highlighting and selections are not shared
- **Edits**: Changes in one pane do NOT sync to the paired pane in real-time

This is intentional—it lets you reference and edit the same file side-by-side without cursor chaos or conflicting edits. You keep full control over each pane's view.

## Comparison with other sync plugins

Many pane-sync plugins sync cursor position, selections, and scroll state. This can cause:
- Unexpected cursor jumps when editing
- Confusion about which pane you're actively typing in
- Scroll position conflicts

This plugin takes a simpler approach: **file opens only**. You see the same file in both panes and can edit independently. This is especially useful for:
- Side-by-side reference viewing
- Comparing different sections of the same file
- Editing different parts without cursor interference

## Settings

- **Enable file sync**: Toggle the entire plugin on/off
- **Auto-restore links on restart**: Automatically restore linked panes when Obsidian restarts (requires the same files to be open)

## Development

### First time developing plugins?

Quick starting guide for new plugin devs:

- Check if [someone already developed a plugin for what you want](https://obsidian.md/plugins)! There might be an existing plugin similar enough that you can partner up with.
- Make a copy of this repo as a template with the "Use this template" button (login to GitHub if you don't see it).
- Clone your repo to a local development folder. For convenience, you can place this folder in your `.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-name` folder.
- Install NodeJS, then run `npm i` in the command line under your repo folder.
- Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
- Make changes to `main.ts` (or create new `.ts` files). Those changes should be automatically compiled into `main.js`.
- Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin.
- Enable plugin in settings window.
- For updates to the Obsidian API run `npm update` in the command line under your repo folder.

### Releasing new releases

- Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
- Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
- Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
- Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
- Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

### Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

- Check the [plugin guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines).
- Publish an initial version.
- Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
- Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.

### How to use

- Clone this repo.
- Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

### Improve code quality with eslint

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code. 
- This project already has eslint preconfigured, you can invoke a check by running`npm run lint`
- Together with a custom eslint [plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/eslint-plugin) for Obsidan specific code guidelines.
- A GitHub action is preconfigured to automatically lint every commit on all branches.

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": {
        "Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
        "GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
        "Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
    }
}
```
